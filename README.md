A collection of Nix expressions for creating Jupyter lab environments

The aim of this repository is to act as a central store of reusable Jupyter lab environments that are reproducibly defined as nix expressions using the mach-nix package.

The name is derived from a sacrifice to the Roman god Jupiter that was often a castrated white lamb or goat.

Mainly for personal use but public in case the examples are helpful to others. Some will still be in draft form, and will be noted with any known issues as comments.
